== DESCRIPTION:

This is an atempt to rewrite the fitnesse-pom-widget found at: http://boss.bekk.no/fitnesse-pom-widget/

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

It's mostly up and running now.

== INSTALL:

1. Clone this project and build it. Copy the fitnesse-pom-widget jar to your FitNesse folder and add it to the FitNesse server classpath.
2. Download latest maven-embedder-dep.jar file and place in the FitNesse server classpath.
3. Create/edit a file plugins.properties in the FitNesse server root directory. This should contain: WikiWidgets=no.bekk.fitnesse.plugins.widgets.PomWidget
4. Restart FitNesse. You should see the PomWidget being loaded:

          $ java -cp fitnesse.jar;lib\fitnesse-pom-widget-1.2.jar;lib\maven-embedder-2.0.4-dep.jar fitnesse.FitNesse
                FitNesse (20050731) Started...
          port:              80
          root page:         fitnesse.wiki.FileSystemPage at ./FitNesseRoot
          logger:            none
          authenticator:     fitnesse.authentication.PromiscuousAuthenticator
          html page factory: fitnesse.html.HtmlPageFactory
          page version expiration set to 14 days.
          Custom wiki widgets loaded:
                no.bekk.fitnesse.plugins.widgets.PomWidget
5. Create a FitNesse page with a reference to your pom (!pom /myproject/pom.xml@~/.m2/repository). This should load your projects classpath into the page. The path after the "@" should point to your maven repository.
